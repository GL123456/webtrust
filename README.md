# Webtrust

Webtrust is a Python library for dealing with fraud in crypto marketplaces.

## Usage

Web3 has reinvented how consumers interact with information. Buyers now rely heavily on online reputation systems for browsing and researching products before making online purchase decisions. Centralized Marketplaces enable us to share ratings and recommend good finds to our online networks. Meanwhile, many centralized marketplaces have built-in censored rating systems for both sellers and buyers it's still difficult for decentrlized marketplaces to establish that trust. 

There are gaping loopholes with web3 reputation systems of today. A lack of robust verification and social credit mechanisms too easily allow sellers to manipulate and fool buyers' perception of themselves and competitors. A decentralized reputation system that leverages network theory and deep learning, would be able to verify and create unique digital identities for all users and aggregate reputation data across the marketplace. Trust and transparency will be restored to online markets, allowing customers to trust reviews and marketplaces to thrive.
